1. Pre-trained model path for "best_model.h5" at mode1

for example:
"C:/Users/vidya Peddinti/Desktop/FLAME/FSP/CSIT431 Adv ML/Emotion-detection-main/Emotion-detection-main/best_model.h5"


2. Give input video path at video_path

for example :
"C:/Users/vidya Peddinti/Desktop/FLAME/FSP/CSIT431 Adv ML/Emotion-detection-main/Emotion-detection-main/V1.mp4"


3. run the code
- go to the directory where the code file is there
- run python name_of_the_file.py

for example in command propmt:
- cd C:/Users/vidya Peddinti/Desktop/FLAME/FSP/CSIT431 Adv ML/Emotion-detection-main/Emotion-detection-main
- python Video_to_Emotion.py


4. Wait for sometime
This will open a pop up window of the video file you have uploaded and gives emotions on the face of the detected humans and also prints the emotion matrix in your console

for example:

1/1 [==============================] - 0s 79ms/step
[0.0, 0.0, 0.002, 0.983, 0.007, 0.008, 0.0]
happy

1/1 [==============================] - 0s 91ms/step
[0.001, 0.0, 0.005, 0.388, 0.538, 0.067, 0.0]
sad


5. Press Esc button
if you want stop the code, press esc button.



Note:
Install the required libraries mentioned in the code using pip, incase the code is giving library errors. 

for example:
pip install tensorflow
